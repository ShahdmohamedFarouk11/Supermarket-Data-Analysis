This project focuses on analyzing supermarket sales data. The data was cleaned and visualized using Excel. I applied clustering techniques like K-Means and used Association Rules to discover relationships between products. The goal was to extract insights and improve decision-making for inventory and marketing strategies.

Key Steps:

Data Cleaning (removing duplicates, fixing missing values).

Data Visualization (charts, summaries).

Applied K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.

Used Association Rules to analyze product combinations.
